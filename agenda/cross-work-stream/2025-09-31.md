Details
AI Note-Taking and Data Management
The meeting began with Andor and Alan discussing technical issues with Zoom updates and the use of note-takers, with Alan expressing support for AI note-takers. Participants from various locations introduced themselves, including Eric, Neil, and Tom, who mentioned issues related to trusted AI agents, model poisoning, and the need for archival documentation of agent-human relationships. The discussion touched on the challenges of managing personal data in hospitality and travel, as well as the potential for "worse is better" approaches in the market.

Trusted AI Agents Working Group Launch
The Trusted AI Agents Working Group was launched to develop a neutral and interoperable stack for trusted AI agents, addressing challenges in decentralized identity and agent authority. Andor explained the group's structure, including quarterly cross-work item meetings and self-organizing focus areas, with the first work item being Agent Authority use cases. Participants expressed interest in additional work items, such as data privacy for agents, and agreed to form new groups if there is sufficient interest and expertise. The group aims to create opinionated solutions for the Trusted AI Agents space, with a focus on agentic requirements and use cases.

Trusted AI Agents Working Group
The meeting introduced the Trusted AI Agents working group, with Andor, Nicola, and Dmitri serving as chairs. Andor shared a document on IAM system hazards and explained that the working group will focus on authorization pitfalls and use cases, with communication happening primarily through the mailing list and Slack channel. The chairs introduced themselves, highlighting their expertise in agent systems, authorization protocols, and standards development. The group discussed the importance of joining the Slack channel for better communication, and Andor encouraged participants to sign up for the mailing list to contribute to ongoing discussions.

Trusted AI Working Group Structure
The group discussed the purpose and structure of their working group focused on Trusted AI agents, with Andor explaining that they will develop frameworks and positions on technology to help create trusted AI agents. Juan raised concerns about parallel work streams potentially conflicting, and Andor clarified that work items would have chairs and follow a consensus process both within and across the broader working group. The conversation ended with participants being asked to complete a form indicating their interest in different work items and their availability, with 11 responses already received.

Agentic AI Identity Workshop Launch
The meeting focused on the upcoming Internet Identity Workshop and the launch of a new working group on agentic AI identity. Kaliya introduced the workshop, which will explore decentralized identity protocols and agentic AI, and invited participants to join. The group discussed various use cases and challenges related to agentic authority, registries, and commerce. Participants were encouraged to add their ideas to a shared diagram using TealDraw. The working group plans to start with agentic authority use cases and will determine the next steps based on the input received. A doodle poll will be created to find a suitable time for future meetings, and participants were reminded to join the mailing list for ongoing discussions.

Next Steps:
Dmitri to create and send out a Doodle poll for scheduling the Agent Authority use cases work item meetings.
All participants to join the mailing list if they haven't already done so.
All participants to continue contributing to the TL Draw whiteboard exercise after the call.
Chairs  to analyze the form responses to determine which work items have enough interest to be pursued.
Chairs to synthesize the whiteboard input and develop proposals for goals and outputs of specific work item streams.
Chairs to review the communication structure on the mailing list to prevent confusion with multiple threads.
Andor to connect with interested participants to potentially arrange introductory sessions on the basics of Trusted AI Agents for those who are exploring the space.
