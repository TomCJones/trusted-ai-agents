**Overview**

The meeting focused on managing and progressing use cases forward, with discussions about starting meetings on time and the importance of having actual users in use cases. The team explored various AI agent use cases, including supply chain scenarios, calendar booking, and travel-related applications, emphasizing the need for trusted sources of information and multiple levels of intermediaries. The group discussed agent identity and responsibility, technology stack requirements, and the process for managing and refining use cases, with plans to continue discussions in the next meeting.

**Use Case Management and Progression**

The meeting began with a discussion about starting meetings on time and managing participants. Tom presented a use case that he had expanded based on Andrew's work, which will be the seventh submitted use case. The group discussed the need to manage and progress use cases forward, as there are currently seven submissions. They also addressed the importance of having actual users in use cases, which Tom highlighted as a personal concern. The meeting was led by Nicola, who shared the agenda, and Andor took attendance. Mark, a new DIF member, introduced himself to the group.

**AI Use Cases and Trust Boundaries**

The team discussed various use cases for AI agents, with Alan presenting a complex supply chain scenario involving multiple trust boundaries and enterprise workflows. Andor emphasized the importance of identifying stakeholders willing to advance each use case, suggesting this could be a key factor in evaluating their feasibility. Alan highlighted that these use cases help identify necessary features for the architecture, such as trust management and agent interactions, even if specific use cases may not be implemented directly.

**AI Use Cases and Implementation Challenges**

The group discussed various use cases for AI agents, focusing on their practical value and implementation challenges. Andor emphasized the importance of validating that developed use cases would benefit real people, while Makki suggested having a variety of use cases even if their exact stakeholders aren't clear yet. Alan highlighted the potential of the calendar booking use case as a test bed for AI agents, noting its adversarial nature and the need for features like discovery, agent communication, and negotiation. Douglas provided insights into the complexities of the travel use case, including multi-level delegations and authorization chains. The group agreed on the potential for collaboration with other working groups to further develop these use cases.

**Travel Use Cases Discussion**

Douglas noted that while a specific use case might not be on the immediate implementation list, it could be socialized within the community to generate interest and workflows over the coming months. Alan highlighted the overlap between the virtual travel agent and enterprise use cases, emphasizing the need for trusted sources of information and multiple levels of intermediaries. Neil pointed out the unique aspects of the travel use case, such as the exchange of personal information and the need for a micro-sharing mechanism to ensure the secure handling of data. The group discussed the differences in data provenance requirements between the hotel booking agent and the calendar agent, with Andor suggesting that the hotel use cases may require more advanced technical solutions.

**AI Governance Use Case Development**

The Working Group is focused on developing a Use Case for governance, with emphasis on retaining information past transactions and defining the scope of allowed actions and conditions. Nicolagallo discussed an industrial environment scenario where AI agents manage sensor data in an oil company setting, highlighting differences between this approach and traditional human-AI interactions. The discussion touched on service mesh projects and identity management, with Nicolagallo noting interesting parallels between current challenges and historical oil industry problems.

**Agent Identity vs Authorization Debate**

The group discussed agent identity and responsibility, with Alan emphasizing that the agent's identity is secondary to authorization and permissions management. Andor expressed concern about the lack of real-world deployment feedback for testing the use case, while Nicole suggested potential testing opportunities. The discussion explored two approaches: using agent identity with carefully managed permissions, or starting with authorization to minimize identity-related complications.

**Digital Identity and Trust Framework**

The group discussed identity and trust in digital systems, with Tom advocating for relationship-based identity rather than endpoint-based identity. Neil shared insights from a UN project on supply chain trust registration, highlighting the need for verifiable registries and organizational trust across boundaries. The team agreed to track Tom's relationship identity documentation in the issues section, with Andor requesting a write-up for better tracking. Alan and Andor also discussed a PR for a use case, seeking feedback from the group.

**Use Case Management Process Review**

The team discussed the process for managing and refining use cases, focusing on how to track and mature approved use cases. Alan shared his experience with creating a pull request and suggested setting up a GitHub action to streamline the process. The group agreed that once a use case is approved, it should be added to a markdown file, with the possibility of having multiple people contribute to the PR. They also discussed the need to prioritize which use case to anchor to, with Andor suggesting they consider other options beyond the current one.

**Use Case Qualification Strategy Discussion**

The team discussed qualifying requirements for use cases, focusing on unique architectural features and enterprise-specific needs. They agreed that leading by component rather than accepting individual use cases might be more effective. Alan and Tom emphasized the importance of distinguishing between individual and enterprise users in travel-related use cases. The group decided to start with agentic discovery as a requirement and to focus on building functional components before expanding features. They planned to continue the discussion in the next meeting.

**Action Items and Tech Stack Requirements**

The meeting focused on action items and technology stack requirements. Andor requested participants to add leads for their use cases and map out technology stack requirements, noting that help could be sought if unable to do so. The group discussed a plan to meet next Monday, and participants expressed gratitude and farewells as the conversation ended.

**Action Items**
1. Tom: Post the relationship identity write-up as a document linked in a new issue in the issues tracker.  
2. All use case proposers/leads: Add a lead for each use case, either in the issue or in the shared sheet.  
3. All use case proposers/leads: Map out technology stack requirements for each use case in the shared sheet (or indicate if help is needed).  
4. Nicola: Lead discussion on use case prioritization and process at the next meeting.  
5. All: Review and provide feedback on Tom's use case in the doc/issue.  
6. Chairs/Andor: Offload the burden of submitting use cases as PRs by helping proposers copy-paste and submit PRs for approved use cases.  
7. All: Consider and discuss at the next meeting the proposal to start by selecting and building out key components (e.g., agentic discovery/registries) and mapping use cases to those components.

* Douglas Rice : Co-Chair of Hospitality Travel Group & DIF. How does AI Agents work with Travel?
* Dimitri : Here to get a minimal set of use cases to work on.
* Jim : Why do we need DID's to solve the use case?
* Juan : Disposition is it requires multiple trust boundaries. 
* Juan : Submit a PR? If you're stepping away, allow chairs write directly to branch?
* Alan : This use case is particular on permissions. Delegation vs. Impersonation. 
* Jim : What the most technically elegant solution is decentralized X?
* Alan : Use cases don't present anything about the solution. The use case is the problem.

## Notes

- Parallelized work items.
- How soon do we want 1 or more
- Fine to work in a google doc.
- Source of truth for a work item.
- Moving to git is an agreement/consensus mechanism.
- Faster to work in Google Docs.
- How soon can there be consensus on V1.
- Sachio : How flexible on the progress
- Andor :
  - Owners of use case will drive how flex.
  - https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trusted-ai-agents/issues/3
- I do think there’s a role for both
- developers are human, today, kind of ;)
- AI soon!
- I think if we align it to the governance will be great, basically answering those 3 questions:
- Goal/Problem: What is the Agent trying to achieve? (e.g., "Run a multi-step workflow across several APIs operating under different security boundaries, with intelligent failure handling.")
Estimated Value: Why is this important? (e.g., "Enhance workflow reliability by enabling adaptive recovery, reducing downtime in cross-system integrations by 20%.")
Required Autonomy (Simple Tag): Does the Agent suggest (Low), execute simple tasks (Medium), or plan/execute complex workflows (High)?
This is also more of the user story section if you will
- Suggestion : Give people that build use cases time to present!


Note: we might have two audiences.

## Action Items: 

- [ ] Develop a plan around timelines
- [ ] Give feedback and finish off issues Use case: Adaptive error handling in multi-step API workflows #3, Detail Governance Process for Accepting Use Cases #5 Bumblefudge/add-usecase-template #2
- [ ] What is the deliverable?

## Goals For Next Call : 

Set a clear course for work in the Working Item.

### How Do We Govern Use Cases

* Use Case Template -- Propose A Template
* Alan Karp -- Setup An Issues Page. SOLID does an issue page.
  *  Cons : Group did not interact well with the use cases.
* Alex Bainsbridge:
  * https://dif.notion.site/HOSPITALITY-TRAVEL-SIG-242105321e1747f8bce776bf634a55b3
  * Pros and Cons : Not everyone can update it
* Prior Art from Ben:
  * https://wallet.storage/user-stories/connect-wallet  
  * https://wallet.storage/user-stories/share-vc
  * https://wallet.storage/user-stories/share-vc-undo
  * https://wallet.storage/user-stories/delete
* Updating and Commenting
  * Sachio : How can Alan's document be applied to different industries.
    * General vs. Specific
    * Mechanism Creations
    * Where can be the one pager?
    * General vs. Specific Categories 
* Tom :
  * Excption to building use cases toward industries.
  * Use Cases should test our ideas?
  * Person Oriented not Industry Oriented. By Human Focal Point.
* Dimitri :
  * Push back on industry specific use case.
  * How do we filter / carry them?
  * If a use case is narrow, hold off on them.
  * Care about genearlity.
  * Drummond +1 to Dmitry's ooint
* Alan :
  * Industry use cases useful for adoption.
  * Not too narrowly focuesed.
* Nicola :
  * Goal : Generate some design patterns.
* Makki :
  * Shouldn't expect industry can inform us.
  * How do we build an ecosystem of Trusted AI Agents. 
* Juan :
  * Propose : Consensus Mechanism
  * Rocketing : I'll contribute
  * Parallelized Activity
  * Write the next one
* Dimitry : Should multiple people be required.
* Alan : Anyone should be able to put a use case up.
* Makki : Use this call to short list the use case.
  * Next Call : Get a sample prepare
*  Use Cases:
*    Agentic AI securely mediates HULA agreements using biometric authentication to verify user identity, assurance and intent. This ensures non-repudiation and trust in digital interactions enabling autonomous agents to execute legally binding actions on behalf of users.
*    As a use case, consider an AI agent that runs a multi-step workflow across several APIs operating under different security boundaries. When one step fails, the agent doesn’t just roll back automatically, it analyzes the situation, checks for possible recovery options, and decides whether to retry, undo previous steps, or report the issue based on simple rules.
* Makki : To help with the governance of the use cases.
* Invitation is All You Need.
* Juan Quick sidebar (people can comment on this message in parallel to the main discussion): what should the template include?
1.) all acting/determinant parties (including agents, AuthZ servers, etc), enumerated and named/represented by a Letter/Number/etc.
2.) specific AuthZ/policy language/DSL reqs (i.e. actor C needs logs about what actors A and B did)
